# CS210-Programming-Languages-C-

In this project my job was to create a program that would read input from a file and output the items in a file with the amount of times the items occured in the file. For example the file lists food items such as potatoes, we would need to read how many times potatoes are on the list and output the name of the time with total amount of the item. Additionally we should also be able to display the quanitity of the items using asterisks instead of numbers. 

What I did well was figuring out how to write the program in a way that it functioned well, and accomplished what was asked of me. 

I think to enhance the code, I would need to continute learning C++ and incorporate techniques as I learn them more. One thing that I struggled with in this course was time. Learning concepts and then applying them quickly become a little difficult, so I think once I can take time to better learn to code in this language I will be able to incorperate new concepts and further build on the program. 

The peices of code that were most difficult for me to write, where the code where we read the input from the file, processed it, and then created a different output file with the information requested. To overcome this, I spent a lot of time reading the materials given to us, and looking up videos online that helped the explain the concepts and how to work them into this project. 

I think all the skills in this project are transferable. This is my third language that I am learning, and so far they all pretty much function in the same way just slightly different. That alone lets me transfer the concepts I learned here to future languages I may learn. When working on other projects I will be able to return here and look over the skills I learned in buildings menu options, and reading and writting files to implement them into future programs. 

To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I wrote a lot of notes. Notes will help future developers as well as my self understand the concepts used, why and how they were used, so that in the event that anything has to be altered it is easible understood why things were built in a certain way.
